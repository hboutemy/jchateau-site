## what is an unconference

The open spaces unconference is the coolest structure for exchanging ideas. The Open Space format has been used more than 60,000 times in at least 124 countries, involving millions of attendees over the past 20 years, so it obviously “just works”. As JCrete® uses it, it is important to understand what type of event an open spaces unconference is.

## Simple Rules

To maximize what you can get out of the unconference, simple rules apply. Wikipedia summarizes them nicely:

1. Whoever shows up are the right people

   …reminds participants that they don’t need the CEO and 100 people to get something done, you need people who care. And, absent the direction or control exerted in a traditional meeting, that’s who shows up in the various breakout sessions of an Open Space meeting.

2. Whenever it starts is the right time

   …reminds participants that spirit and creativity do not run on the clock.

3. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
   …reminds participants that once something has happened, it’s done—and no amount of fretting, complaining or otherwise rehashing can change that. Move on.

4. Wherever it happens is the right place

   …reminds participants that space is opening everywhere all the time. Please be conscious and aware.

5. When it’s over, it’s over

   …reminds participants that we never know how long it will take to resolve an issue, once raised, but that whenever the issue or work or conversation is finished, move on to the next thing. Don’t keep rehashing just because there’s 30 minutes left in the session. Do the work, not the time.

_Be prepared to be surprised! 🙂 Engage with the process._

## In short:

* An unconference is a **participant-driven** meeting. In other words: **you decide** what topics you want to talk about, and work on, with whom – instead of hoping a “speaker” will address that topic at least briefly.
* Open Space (“Open Space Technology”, OST) is a specific form of an unconference that starts with an empty schedule. No topics are mandated, no separations are made between “speakers” and “audience”. All participants work out a schedule by suggesting, planning, holding and evaluating sessions, **collaboratively**.
* Since everything is created collaboratively by the participants, obviously it matters which people feel invited, and how to “call” them together. This is one of the reasons that JCrete® is an invitation-only event.
