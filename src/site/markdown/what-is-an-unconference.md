## What is an unconference

The open spaces unconference is the coolest structure for exchanging ideas. The Open Space format has been used more than 60,000 times in at least 124 countries, involving millions of attendees over the past 20 years, so it obviously ‚Äújust works‚Äù. 

Harrison Owens, the creator of this technology wrote an extensive 62-pages document on Open space conferences that you can find [here](https://elementaleducation.com/wp-content/uploads/temp/OpenSpaceTechnology--UsersGuide.pdf).


## Four, Very Simple Rules

To maximize what you can get out of the unconference, four simple rules apply. Wikipedia summarizes them nicely:

1. Whoever shows up are the right people

   ‚Ä¶reminds participants that they don‚Äôt need the CEO and 100 people to get something done. All you need is people who care. And, absent the direction or control exerted in a traditional meeting, that‚Äôs who shows up in the various breakout sessions of an Open Space meeting.

2. Whenever it starts is the right time

   ‚Ä¶reminds participants that spirit and creativity do not run on the clock.

3. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
   
   ‚Ä¶reminds participants that once something has happened, it‚Äôs done‚Äîand no amount of fretting, complaining or otherwise rehashing can change that. Move on.

4. Wherever it happens is the right place

   ‚Ä¶reminds participants that space is opening everywhere all the time. Please be conscious and aware.

5. When it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over

   ‚Ä¶reminds participants that we never know how long it will take to resolve an issue, once raised, but that whenever the issue or work or conversation is finished, move on to the next thing. Don‚Äôt keep rehashing just because there‚Äôs 30 minutes left in the session. Do the work, not the time.
   
   And yes, that's make it five rules. But you know, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition...

## In Short

* JChateau is an unconference where the agenda for the current day is decided every morning by the participants. Some participants, maybe all of them, will propose subjects. Then the participants work out the schedule by suggesting, planning, holding an evaluating sessions, together. 

* If, as a participant, you submit a subject, what you are really doing is committing to be in the room you have been assigned to at the right time, and make sure a discussion on that subject will take place with the people that show up. 

* No topics are mandated, there is no separation between speakers and audience.
