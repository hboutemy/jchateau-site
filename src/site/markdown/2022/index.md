## First answer: an unconference

JChateau® is an **Unconference** organized in France in the iconic area of the Châteaux of the Loire Valley, designated as a World Heritage Site by UNSECO in 2000. The people behind this event are the same that have been organizing the Paris Java User Group meet-ups for about 10 years.
***But this year we go Virtual***.

## Second answer: a non-profit event

Everything has a price, and organizing such an event has one too. So unfortunately, attending JCHateau cannot be free. Despite that, it is still a non-profit event, organized by the same non-profit association that has been organizing the Paris Java User Group meet-ups for the past 5 years.
***But this year we will be Free of charge***.

## Third answer: an event for passionate people

JChateau® is disorganized by a group of people that have the same passion for technology, especially Java technology, and for sharing knowledge. Everyone interested in the Java technologies, the crafting of software, and all the related technologies is very welcome to attend and join the party. 

## Fourth answer: a fun event!

Sharing three to four days in a venue where everybody can discuss, have lunch and dinner, share a coffee, go for a walk in the nearby forrest, leave the venue for an early morning run, talk about Java, this is great unfortunalty it is not currently possible. Nevetheless we will go Virtual and this allow us to do it with our friend from Scoctland (aka [JAlba](https://jalba.scot/))

## JChateau is not the first one

JChateau® is fully inspired by [JCrete](http://www.jcrete.org/), [JAlba](https://jalba.scot/) and [SoCraTes](https://socrates-fr.github.io/). Thanks to all the disorganizers of these events for their inspiration and encouragements. Without your work, JChateau wouldn't have been created!
